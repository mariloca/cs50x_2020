        <p class="quote">"But before William Stoner the future lay bright and certain and unchanging. He saw it, not as a flux of event and change and potentially, but as a territory ahead
            that awaited his exploration. He saw it as the great University library, to which new wings might be built, to which new books might be
            added and from which old ones might be withdrawn, while its true nature remained essentially unchanged. He saw the future in the institution to which
            he had comitted himself and which he so imperfectly understood; he conceived himself changing in that future,
            but he saw the future itself as the instrument of change rather than its object."</p>
